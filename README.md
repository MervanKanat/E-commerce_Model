# E-commerce Attribution Model Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on developing an attribution model for an e-commerce dataset in BigQuery. The aim is to analyze how different marketing channels contribute to sales and conversions in an e-commerce setting.

## Scenario

You have access to a dataset from an e-commerce website in BigQuery. This dataset records customer interactions across various marketing channels. The primary objective is to understand the effectiveness of these channels in driving sales and conversions.

## Task

Your task is to create an attribution model using the e-commerce dataset in BigQuery. This model will help determine the most effective marketing channels and customer touchpoints for driving conversions and sales.

## Expected Deliverables

### 1. Data Exploration and Cleaning

- Examine and clean the dataset, focusing on customer interactions, sales, and marketing channels.
- Perform necessary preprocessing to prepare the data for attribution modeling.

### 2. Attribution Modeling

- Develop an attribution model to assess the impact of different marketing channels on sales and conversions.
- Use a combination of statistical methods and machine learning techniques for the model.

### 3. Insight and Recommendation

- Derive key insights from the attribution model.
- Provide actionable recommendations to optimize marketing strategies.
- Suggest additional metrics or data points for enhancing the model.

## Guidance

- Employ a data-driven approach to understand customer journeys and marketing effectiveness.
- Leverage SQL, statistical methods, and machine learning in your analysis.
- Focus on insights that inform strategic marketing decisions in an e-commerce environment.

## Dataset

You may use BigQuery sample datasets. The dataset titled "ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce" is suitable for this project. It can be found at:

[BigQuery Public Dataset: ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=ga4_obfuscated_sample_ecommerce&t=events_20210131&page=table&pli=1&supportedpurview=project)

## Getting Started

1. Access the BigQuery console and locate the sample dataset.
2. Familiarize yourself with the data structure and available fields.
3. Begin with exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. Proceed with data cleaning and preprocessing as necessary.
5. Develop your attribution model using appropriate techniques.
6. Analyze results and prepare your insights and recommendations.

## Submission

Please submit your project including:

- SQL queries used for data exploration and preprocessing
- Code for the attribution model
- A report detailing your findings, insights, and recommendations

Good luck with your project!
